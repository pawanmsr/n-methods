Build
-----

Build using CMake.

```shell
# Run build script.
bash build.sh [options: -h|c]
# Note: for minor modifications, run without flags
# or options to use build cache for quicker builds.

```

Notes and More
--------------

Source code in [src](/src/) for sport programming, assessments and limited use of STLs.  

Run the build before copying the source templates into the solution. At least add basic tests for all new implementations.
Tests in [test](/test/) and method signatures in [include](/include/). Run CTest to verify and trust source code.

TODO: add (possibly funny) comic strip (maybe interactive and with links) about a Padawan that desires to be a Master. Add the one with Wolf, Tortoise and Cat sitting beside the window discussing differences and while the wolf tries to come up with a solution.
