Build
-----

Build using CMake.

```shell
# Run build script.
bash build.sh [options: -h|c]
# Note: for minor modifications, run without flags
# or options to use build cache for quicker builds.

```

Notes and More
--------------

Source code in [src](/src/) for sport programming, assessments and limited use of STLs.  

Use small functions at the top of the solution. Append larger functions or group of functions with function declarations at the top. Lookout for sneaky signed overflows. Use C-style io and initializations for slightly quicker execution. Constant access time for large arrays (upwards of ten power six) increases dramatically - prefer hashmaps.

Run the build before copying the source templates into the solution. At least add basic tests for all new implementations.
Tests in [test](/test/) and method signatures in [include](/include/). Run CTest to verify and trust source code.

TODO: add (possibly funny) comic strip (maybe interactive and with links) about a Padawan that desires to be a Master. Add the one with Wolf, Tortoise and Cat sitting beside the window discussing differences and while the wolf tries to come up with a solution.
