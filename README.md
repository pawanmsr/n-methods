Notes and More
--------------

Source code in [src](/src/) for sport programming, assessments and limited use of STLs.  

Run the build before copying the source templates into the solution. At least add basic tests for all new implementations.
Tests in [test](/test/) and method signatures in [include](/include/). Run CTest to verify and trust source code.
