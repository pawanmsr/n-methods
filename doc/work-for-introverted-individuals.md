Seeking and Navigating Work for Introverted Individuals
=======================================================

I wrote this for myself for entry level / junior level positions. Adapted from my journal entry from December, 2018.

Drag happens due to external force(s)! Reduce drag by streamlining!  

- High Affinity and High Skill: Avoid overdoing it or doing it for free!  
- Low Affinity but High Skill: Do it if incentivised!  
- High Affinity but Low Skill: Learn it!  
- Low Affinity and Low Skill: Nah! No! Nahi! Nako! Nyet! Nein! Non!

People
------

People are difficult-to-solve puzzles. Leave it to those who are good with people, and those who are good with valuing them.  

If need be, then always try to create a win-win situation whether it be a group project or team sport. Everyone has different likes and dislikes: try to adhere, and respect each of them. It is near impossible to make everyone happy.  

It is important to get inspired by the positives.  

Skilling Up
-----------

There are different strategies (according to people's advice) that lie on the following spectrum ends:

1. Fake it till you make it!  
2. Figure it out and work towards it!

Follow the first one if desperate, and switch to something closer to second one for all other other times.

The Why?
--------

- Small entities ask: "Will you be able to survive within our company?"  
- Large entities ask: "Why should we hire you?"

They usually imply:

- "We are trying to build a table that we don't quite know the looks of; can you help us figure out the pieces without falling apart yourself?" and  
- "What do you bring to the table?"

respectively.

Reply with strengths and weaknesses.

Improvement
-----------

Mistakes and errors can be identified from negative feedback received later on. Doing things correctly, on the other hand, either has NO feedback, or ONLY has positive feedback. “Virtue is more to be feared than vice, because its excesses are not subject to the regulation of conscience.” (Adam Smith. TMS). Maintain restraint whenever possible.
