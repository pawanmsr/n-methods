> Losers' Cry Before Another Try  
>
> When I was young, I seldom cried.  
> "Man up", they said, "or a loser you will be."  
> Now I am older, and somewhat fried.  
> Aye, cried I have, but a loser I will never be.  
> For the burdens we carry, they never get to see,  
> And leaving everything behind does not set us free.  
> A solemn warrior burns even when it is wise to flee,  
> As freedom lies in honouring a lifetime of decree.  
> <cite>Pawan</cite> ([inspired](/doc/footnotes.md), impersonal but original).

Reminder
--------

There will be time for fun always. Finish up the primary quickly - don't end up like the unconnected blip in *Conway, J. H.*'s Life. Also, write something funny about fields, groups and rings sometime later.
