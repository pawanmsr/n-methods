Fun and Learning
================

Comics, Poetry are just for laughs and learning.  

Implementations and Exercises
-----------------------------

- [ ] Splines
- [x] Splay tree
- [ ] Interpolation
- [ ] Geometry and Mesh (2D)
- [ ] Simulate Statistics (on particles / quanta)
  - [ ] Density Functionals (refer nature)
  - [ ] Fermi - Dirac (on fermions)
  - [ ] Bose - Einstein (on bosons)
- [ ] . . .
- [ ] (Redo with) Parallel processing
- [ ] Simulate Qubit (derived data with induced probability, SIMD, SIMT)

Communication:

- [x] Data serialization
- [ ] Create (easy) communication protocol or use pre-existing protocol buffer
- [ ] Java/Go/Python or any other that are in popular use, for Interfaces (Native or using Framework)

Don't end up like the unconnected blip in *Conway, J. H.*'s Life (or get jinxed in a resource constrained environment). Use vocal chords - communication is the key that resolves deadlocks.

Spare-time Study
----------------

- [ ] Finite mathematics and algebraic structures particularly fields, groups and rings.
- [ ] Atmospheric physics, CFD, turbulence and non-linear dynamics.

Create comics if possible.
