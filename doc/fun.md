> Losers' Cry Before Another Try

> When I was young, I seldom cried.  
> "Man up", they said, "or a loser you will be."  
> Now I am older, and somewhat fried.  
> Aye, cried I have, but a loser I will never be.  
> For the burdens we carry, they never get to see,  
> And leaving everything behind does not set us free.  
> A solemn warrior burns even when it is wise to flee,  
> As freedom lies in honouring a lifetime of decree.

Mingling CBA
------------

Don't end up like the unconnected blip in *Conway, J. H.*'s Life (or get jinxed in a resource constrained environment). Use vocal chords - communication is the key that resolves deadlocks.

Spare-time Study
----------------

- [ ] Finite mathematics and algebraic structures particularly fields, groups and rings.
- [ ] Atmospheric physics, CFD, turbulence and non-linear dynamics.

Create comics if possible.
