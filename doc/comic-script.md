Comic Script
============

Padawan is participating in a contest that will help him achieve something. Billi is a cat. Tori is a tortoise.  

**Padawan**: Look at all these people bolting past. A disgrace of astronomical proportions. I feel so inadequate and worthless - feel like giving up!

**Billi** (Sarcastically): Yeah totally. Completely agreed. Your existence is futile. Pass on that snacks and empty the litter box on your way out.  

**Torti**: Now is not the time to get [Comfortably Numb](). *Maybe the wolf no longer feels hungry enough!* Think about all the hopes, dreams and desires! What about discovering the secrets of the universe? What about the PhD you always wanted to pursue - 'doctor' does sound cool before your name, doesn't it? What about cosmology, and black hole dynamics, and QM - I am pretty sure you still don't understand more than half of it! What about Irodov's Problems - you still haven't solved it all - you cannot leave it unfinished . . . *anxiety starts to percolate* . . . what about the increasing stack of unread books, languages to learn, music to play, and legions of unsolved problems - forget about grad level exams and putnam papers, you still haven't reconciled with the regional olympiad papers . . . *anxiety pours* . . . so many people to meet, understand and learn from, all those bills and taxes to pay, places to visit - think about Sanchi, Konark, Hampi, Taj - all the museums and libraries to go to . . . *anxiety avalanche falls* . . . what about your dream laboratory and the tools and equipments that go in it. YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN AND BUILD! So, you better straighten up Soldier. Battle formation, prepare to flank and re-engage.  
Hey Smart AI Assistant, please play [Born To Run]().  

**Smart AI Assistant**: Right away (wannabe Master but still a) Padawan's pet Torti. Music subscription renewed! Playing [I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For](). Enjoy the beat(ing)s LOL.  

**Billi**: That [Master Oogway]() is probably going to live to one fifty! Keep listening to him, and you will end up like a wilted candle, because *[Aakash Ke Us Paar]() bhi aakash hain*!

**Dumb and Confused Padawan**: No, I don't. Go away. I have a side quest to complete! I want to draw a comic about a [Starman]() looking [Down to Earth]() wondering . . . TO BE ADDED

THE END.
