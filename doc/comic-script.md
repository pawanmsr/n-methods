Comic Script
============

Padawan is participating in a contest that will help him achieve something. Billi is a cat. Tori is a tortoise.  

**Padawan**: Look at all these people bolting past. A disgrace of astronomical proportions. I feel so inadequate and worthless - feel like giving up!

**Billi** (Sarcastically): Yeah totally. Completely agreed. Your existence is futile. Pass on that snacks and empty the litter box on your way out.  

**Torti**: Now is not the time to get [Comfortably Numb](). *Maybe the wolf no longer feels hungry enough!* Think about all the hopes, dreams and desires! What about discovering the secrets of the universe? What about the PhD you always wanted to pursue - 'doctor' does sound cool before your name, doesn't it? What about cosmology, and black hole dynamics, and QM - I am pretty sure you still don't understand more than half of it! What about Irodov's Problems - you still haven't solved it all - you cannot leave it unfinished . . . *anxiety starts to percolate* . . . what about the increasing stack of unread books, languages to learn, music to play, and legions of unsolved problems - forget about grad level exams and putnam papers, you still haven't reconciled with the regional olympiad papers . . . *anxiety pours* . . . so many people to meet, understand and learn from, all those bills and taxes to pay, places to visit - think about Sanchi, Konark, Hampi, Taj - all the museums and libraries to go to . . . *anxiety avalanche falls* . . . what about your dream laboratory and the tools and equipments that go in it. YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN AND BUILD! So, you better straighten up Soldier. Battle formation, prepare to flank and re-engage.  
Hey Smart AI Assistant, please play [Born To Run]().  

**Smart AI Assistant**: Right away (wannabe Master but still a) Padawan's pet Torti. Music subscription renewed! Playing [I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For](). Enjoy the beat(ing)s LOL.  

**Billi**: That [Master Oogway]() is probably going to live to one fifty! Keep listening to him, and you will end up like a wilted candle, because *[Aakash Ke Us Paar]() bhi aakash hain*! Look at Mr. Rodeo over there in the distance, flooring his supercharged 5 litre 600 horsepower twin turbo V10 beast playing [Jeene Ke Hain Char Din]() from its explosive woofers with les femmes beaux in the backseat. I like Mr Rodeo's "Chillout Pro Max Ultra" philosophy over your "Honour and Glory" stupidity. Mr Rodeo is cool. Be like Mr Rodeo. Moreover, didn't someone admirable say that life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take your breath away - I am sure darting at 90 on a 40 kmph limit will [Take My Breath Away]().  

**Confused Padawan**: I don't think the admirable person meant that by saying so. On the other hand, that supercar seems quite interesting. I am pretty sure I can squeeze more horsepower out from those specifications.  

**Billi**: And all the while paddle shifting from high two to low four almost instantaneously - meow to my ears.  
All of this reminds me of another song. Hey, Smart AI Assistant, play [Fast Cars]()!  

**Smart AI Assistant**: Right away (wannabe Master but still a) Padawan's pet Billi. Playing [Blowing In The Wind]().  

**Confused Padawan**: How do you know so much about Mr Rodeo?  

**Billi**: I was his pet during my seventh life till he pressed the brakes too hard. I blasted through the windshield and splat onto the *OK* of *Horn OK Please* written at the back of a lorry. Vehicles don't have seatbelts for pets, you see. I was married then, but the contract ended right after the accident. This is my last but one life.  TODO.

TODO.

**Torti**: TODO. In any case, you don't want to end up being labelled as an undeniable low performing piss pot, do you?  

**Dumb and Confused Padawan**: No, I don't. Go away. I have a side quest to complete! I want to draw a comic about a [Starman]() looking [Down To Earth (Wall-E)]() wondering . . . TODO.  

**Smart AI Assistant**: Right away (wannabe Master but still a dumb) Padawan. Playing [Rocket Man (I Think it's Going To Be A Long Long Time)]().  

TODO  

**THE END**.
