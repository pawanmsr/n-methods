Comic Script
============

Padawan is participating in a contest that will help him achieve something. Billi is a cat. Tori is a tortoise.  

**Padawan**: Look at all these people bolting past. A disgrace of astronomical proportions. I feel so inadequate and worthless - feel like giving up!

**Billi** (Sarcastically): Yeah totally. Completely agreed. Your existence is futile. Pass on that snacks and empty the litter box on your way out.  

**Torti**: Now is not the time to get [Comfortably Numb](). *Maybe the wolf no longer feels hungry enough!* Think about all the hopes, dreams and desires! What about discovering the secrets of the universe? What about . . . TO BE ADDED

TODO

**Billi**: That [Master Oogway]() is probably going to live to one fifty! Keep listening to him, and you will end up like a wilted candle, because *[Aakash Ke Us Paar]() bhi aakash hain*!

TODO

**Dumb and Confused Padawan**: No, I don't. Go away. I have a side quest to complete! I want to draw a comic about a [Starman]() looking [Down to Earth]() wondering . . . TO BE ADDED

TODO

THE END.
