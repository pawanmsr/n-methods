Comic Script
------------

While strolling through a forlorn place, Padawan stumbles upon a rack of earthen jugs. All of them are brimming with rain water, but one of them is as dry as a tropical summer. With all the dust gathered on and around, it seems to be sitting there since eons, and yet it is unfazed by the rain that has be pouring lately. Padawan picks it up to see if there are any seepages. Right when he is leering inside the jug scanning for defects, the jug crackles up and from it arises a Genie.

**Genie** (yawns): Hi there! I am the Genie of the bottle. Let me grant you a wish for doing so will free me from this centuries long captivity.  

**Padawan** (dumbfounded): Really? AWESOME! I want a computing device with extreme processor interlaced with multiple graphics processing unit and high data rate memory all synchronized to operate at peak frequencies while being immersed completely in some volatile fluid such as methanol.

**Genie**: I did not understand any of what you said except the part where you talk about alcohol immersion. I have been sleeping for half a millennium, please consider that before you specify your demand.

**Padawan**: It is an organized collection of chips which are made from crystalline wafer that has been subjected to vapour deposition forming dense network of nanometer scale electrical components with help of machines that are controlled by chips made of similar wafers but slightly less dense in number of components, that have been assembled using machines that are controlled by similar wafers but even less dense in number of components probably at micrometer scale . . . built using tools and machines that operate at millimeter scale assembled by human hands. The chips are then neatly arranged on a board, just like all the toppings and condiments placed on a pizza dough, and then backed and packed in a box often made out of sheet metal or moulded plastic.

**Genie**: I understand that humans built large machines that helped them design and build progressively smaller yet quicker machines, but what are those components that you mentioned?

**Padawan**: These components are miniature parts of whole that run on electricity . . . *goes on to explain the versatile form of energy and its uses*.

**Genie**: Isn't the device peeking out of your bag, similar to the one you described?

**Padawan**: Yes, but the one in my bag stops responding often, especially while running intensive applications. My small programs too often cause it cry and pant like a blow dryer on a ventilator.

**Genie**: You have got one wish kid - why blow it on something you can get by other means?

**Padawan**: You seem charitable for someone who wants to break out of captivity. How did you end up in the jug anyways, or has it always been your home?

**Genie**: Oh no, this bottle was never my home.

**Padawan**: Momentarily?! How did you mess up?

**Genie**: I drank up all the water from that bottle, first thing.

**Smart AI Assistant**: Should have made a deal with the devil instead of praying to the heavens - I bet it wouldn't have been worse than ending up bottled up. LOL.

**Genie**: WHO SAID THAT?! What is that thing?

**Padawan**: Oh that too is a genie except its bottle is more modern, and it does not grant wishes. It is called a Transformer.

**Genie**: Transformer? Like the step-up and step-down one you mentioned earlier?

**Padawan**: No. This is more like a directed mathematical graph that needed attention.

**Genie**: Did it receive all the attention it needed?

**Padawan**: Plenty. Do you think you can grant me a bunch of discoveries in my fields of study and the ability to publish it?

**Genie**: No, I cannot.

**Padawan**: Why not?

**Genie**: I am a Djinn of the past. I do not know what more there is and I cannot grant what I do not know. I hope you meet Doraemon someday or come across the pencil from Shaka-Laka-Boom-Boom!

**Padawan**: FINE. Grant me: the ability to hang from a tree like the langur, sprint like the cheetah, swim like a dolphin, fly like a falcon, thick-skinned like a rhinoceros, resourcefulness of an elephant, stamina of a horse, valor of a lion, beauty of a peacock, and most importantly, foresight of a chessmaster.

**Genie**: You ask too much. You have to pick one. That is about a dozen wishes all combined into one!

**Padawan**: So, combine them into one! I don't want just one. I want to be [Everything At Once](https://youtu.be/eE9tV1WGTgE?si=H39Hai5LaKiixsSN).  

**Genie**: Well, I do know of one way. Let me define you a function of time who exists as a superposition of everything.

```latex
\begin(equation)
\ket{Me(t)} \cong \alpha \ket{Langur(hang, t)} + \beta \ket{Cheetah(sprint, t)} + \gamma \ket{Dolphin(swim, t)} + \delta \ket{Falcon(fly, t)} + \\ \epsilon \ket{Elephant(resourcefulness, t)} + \zeta \ket{Rhinoceros(skin, t)} + \eta \ket{Horse(stamina, t)} + \theta \ket{Lion(valor, t)} + \\ \kappa \ket{Peacock(beauty, t)} + \lambda \ket{ChessMaster(foresight, t)}
\end(equation)

```

Then, at any particular time, your aura would be:

```latex
\begin(equation)
||Me||^{2} = \bra{Me} \ket{Me}_{t = T}
\end(equation)

```

If all the characteristics (vector functions) were independent (orthogonal) then their contribution to your aura would be proportional to the squares of all the normalizing factors. Clearly, some of the vector pairs are not orthogonal - they intermix and coalesce. For instance, a sprinter does not always have the best stamina whereas the horse cannot run as fast as a cheetah.

```latex
\bra{Me(sprint, stamina)} \ket{Me(sprint, stamina)}_{t = T} \cong \beta^{2} \bra{Cheetah(sprint)}\ket{Cheetah(sprint)})_{t = T} + \beta \eta \bra{Cheetah(sprint)} \ket{Horse(stamina)}_{t = T} + \eta \beta \bra{Horse(stamina)}) \ket{Cheetah(sprint)}_{t = T} + \eta^{2} \bra{Horse(stamina)} \ket{Horse(stamina)}_{t = T}

```

The bra-ket is essentially the square of the probability of you having those characteristics at a particular time. You just get to choose those vector functions at the start in such a way that they obey the rules of nature.

TODO.

**Padawan**: Thank you O Great Genie. My gratitude towards you fail every test of convergence. I hope you mess up again and I get a chance to meet you to learn something more.
