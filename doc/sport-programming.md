Logistics
---------

Use own or familiar device or get familiar with available workstation. Make sure all keys work especially if keyboard is battered - if they all don't then make a note of disabled keys to avoid naming variables that spell with disabled letters - and try not to use on-screen keyboard or touch screens. Download the compressed file of the repository or use version control if available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ascertain device specification specially when solution programs need to be run locally or results uploaded in absence of online judgement.
>
> Prefer 64 bit machine and install 64 bit compiler (if not pre-installed).

- Architecture and compiler compatibility
- Stack size and memory
- Stream buffer

Milestones
----------

Ratings are important, but learning and improvements are more important - consider blue as benchmark and try to reach above. Same goes for everything else. Register only if interested - unrated otherwise. Have fun!  

- [x] Become Cyan.  
- [ ] Become Blue.  
- [ ] Become Purple.  
    Frame it with caption:  
    "Now I have become Purple, a mixture of blue and red." :joy:  
- [ ] Become Yellow (if it ever happens).  
    Frame it within a golden frame with caption:  
    "Mellow Master Me" :satisfied:  

Be impervious to AI agents. It is an art (albeit a difficult one)! Read instructions and checklists often.
